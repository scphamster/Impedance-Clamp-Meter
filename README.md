<h2>Principles of work</h2>
The main principles behind the ICM are the utilization of the <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amp%C3%A8re%27s_circuital_law>Ampere's Law</a> and <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lock-in_amplifier>Lock-In Amplifier</a>.
Leveraging these two physical phenomenons we are able to detect very small currents in distinct wires in electrical circuits with no need to make any disconnections in the measured circuit(which are sometimes forbidden) to check the 
the impedance of specific branches.

<h2>Schematics and PCB</h2>
